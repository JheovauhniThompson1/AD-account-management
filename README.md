<h1>Managing Accounts with Azure VMs</h1>
This tutorial outlines the Enabling, Unlocking of Accounts and how to Reset Passwords a Pre-made Windows Server Virtual Machine(Azure).<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Users and Computers
- Windows 10 Settings(VM)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Mangement Steps</h2>

- Got logged into the Windows Server and picked a random user
- Attempted to login to Client-1 with the wrong password multiple times 
- Configured Group Policy to restrict users to only 5 failed password attempts
- Attempted to log back into Client-1 after 6 failed attempts
- Unlocked Account in DC-1 and attempted to login with the correct password
- Observed the Logs in Client-1

For this repository, I first logged into the Domain Controller as jane_admin, opened Active Directory Users and Computers, and then chose a random user from the 7,500 we had previously generated. In this situation, it was the user "luka.jaj". After approximately 10 failed attempts, I didnâ€™t receive any warning for "too many failed attempts" or an account lockout. Given this, I proceeded to configure the group policy to limit failed login attempts to 5 before triggering an account lockout.

<p>
To configure this specific group policy, I first returned to the Domain Controller and opened Group Policy Management. From there, I navigated to the Default Domain Policy, edited it, and went to Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Account Policies > Account Lockout Policy. I opened the policy and set the Account Lockout Threshold to 5, with the other settings applying automatically. Next, I linked the GPO to the _EMPLOYEES Organizational Unit by right-clicking the OU and selecting Link an Existing GPO. To speed up the process, I forced the Group Policy update by opening a command prompt and running gpupdate /force.

<p>
To test the new policy, I attempted to log back into Client-1 with 6 failed password attempts, and it worked as expected! Since the policy was functioning properly, I returned to the Domain Controller, re-enabled luka.jaj's account, and successfully logged in with the correct password.

Going back to the Windows 10 Virtual Machine (now referred to as client-1), I logged in as solaris\jane_admin, opened the Settings application, and searched for "Remote Desktop Settings." Under User Accounts, I clicked on Select users that can remotely access this PC and added Domain users.

<p>
Afterwards I logged back into DC-1 as solaris.com\jane_admin, opened PowerShell ISE as an administrator, created a new file, pasted the contents of a pre-made script into it, and saved it as "multiuser_creation." I then ran the script. The script works by randomly generating a total of 7,500 users with random names. However, the users do not have random passwords, as that would be cumbersome to manage. Instead, they all share a single password: Password1.
